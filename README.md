# 702project

Potential Project Ideas:
- Patient-Condition Manifolds from EHR + Knowledge Graphs: Using MIMIC and PrimeKG, encode patient trajectories using a temporal encoder and use contrastive learning to group similar patients. This would allow us to learn a continuous patient manifold where geometry reflects disease progression and treatment response instead of discrete ICD codes.
- Clinically Grounded Counterfactual Explanations for Existing Risk Prediction Models: We would develop a counterfactual explanation framework for clinical risk models that generates minimal interventions to change patient outcomes while enforcing biomedical plausibility/constraints derived from clinical knowledge graphs and domain expertise.
- Evaluating Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Fairness and Bias: We would study structural and representational imbalance in biomedical KGs and its implications for discovery
